Transference is a utility to help you copy & move files (and folders) quickly
and precisely. Unlike Finder, which uses multiple windows and dragging,
Transference is based around a 2-pane metaphor. In the left pane you specify
the files to be transferred, in the right pane you specify the destination,
then you trigger the transfer. Simple!

No more dropping things on the wrong folder, or having the folder window you
want disappear at the last moment, or spring open in the wrong place, or any
of the other myriad ways Finder can trip you up.
